A run takes hours and the vendors go at once, so "how far along is each one, and what is it
costing" is the question the terminal should be answering the whole time. A log line per
provider interleaves into noise once more than one vendor is writing it.

THREE LAYERS, AND ONLY THE LAST ONE KNOWS ABOUT A TERMINAL:

    Stats        plain counters. No formatting, no output, no lock.
    format_*     Stats -> one string, and `render` -> one table. Pure, so the layout is
                 testable without a tty.
    Progress     the terminal: a rich `Live`, and what a log line does to it.

`Progress` is also the only thing that needs a lock, because the providers run concurrently and
each adapter has a pool behind it, shared by its runs. `Stats` is touched under that lock and nowhere else.

NOT A TTY -> NOT A TABLE. Piped to a file or running in CI there is nothing to redraw, and a
table every ten pages is worse in a log than a line, so the same counters come out as a
periodic line per provider. The caller does not choose: `Progress` reads the stream and decides.

Colour carries only what the numbers already say -- red where errors are not zero, green where
a provider is finished -- so a terminal that strips it loses nothing.
